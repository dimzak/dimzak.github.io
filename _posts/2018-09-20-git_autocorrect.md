What's your favorite git command?  
Mine is by far `git stauts`!!!  
Of course that's not a command but there is a way to make it!  

`Git autocorrect` solves that by setting:
```javascript
git config --global help.autocorrect 1
```
or add above property in your global git config,  
or not global, maybe typos occur only in a specific repo :laughing:.
