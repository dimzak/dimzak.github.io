Hi I'm Dimitris, welcome to my blog!  

This is a place to keep my thoughts, mostly about work as my mind is running OutOfMemory.  
My basic interests are around cloud, mostly `AWS`, but always checking alternatives :wink:.  
I started as a software engineer so there's gonna be some code too, not just json and yaml.
